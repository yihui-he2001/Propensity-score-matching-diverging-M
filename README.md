This repository provides the results for

On propensity score matching with a diverging number of matches

Yihui He and Fang Han, 2023.

All the simulations can be done by running main.R. In main.R, we source create_dataset1.R and create_dataset2.R to generate data and source produce_table.R to make tables under the two designs. In the folder "working_data", we saves the results of all Monte Carlo simulations. In the folder "tables", we save the tables about some summary statistics of the simulations.
